The object translations are a bit altered, to:

cube: (2,-1.5,-6);
pyramid: (-2,-0.5,-6);
sphere: (0,4,-15);

We have added and used the classes polygon and multipolygon. 
The polygon class represents a single triangular polygon,
while multipolygon represents a single shape by holding
non-duplicate vertex coordinates and defining its polygon
object members by the index numbers of these non-duplicate
vertices. RBG values correspond with XYZ values respectively.
