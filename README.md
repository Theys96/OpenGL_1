# OpenGL_1
### Computer Graphics assignment in OpenGL

For this exercise we implemented the rendering of a predefined cube and pyramid and a sphere from an .obj file.

### Alterations and choices

* The object translations are a bit altered to make better use of the entire viewing screen, to:
    * cube: (2,-1.5,-6)
    * pyramid: (-2,-0.5,-6)
    * sphere: (0,4,-15)
* We have added and used several abastraction classes in the refactoring process of the application.
* The colors are directly derived from the original unit positions, XYZ for RGB respectively.
* Scrolling can be used to control scaling.
